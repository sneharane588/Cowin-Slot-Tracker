# Cowin-Slot-Tracker

Python script to display available slots by Pincode for Covid Vaccine.

--do visit master branch for code--

This script uses Cowin API (made available by Goverment of India) <br>
These APIs are available for use by all third party applications.<br>
Please refer: https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin/cowin-public-v2<br>

<br>
Here as you can see,<br>
I've added a little inputbox to accept pincode from user,<br/><br/>

Slots are rarely available these days, 
<br/>but this is my small attempt to buuild a script which will show the slots availibility without actually visiting to Cowin's website.<br/>

<strong>Future Scope:</strong>
<em>There are many ideas to implement and take this script forwodr to the automation !!<br/>
  - Adding WhatsApp / SMS / Telegram / Email alerts ....(Twilio API)  ..(in progress)
  - Adding notification sounds so that it'll grab user's attention as soon as it rings ...(alerts sounds with help of PyGame module)
